# TicTacToe Combat

## Rules
X always goes first. If a player is able to draw three X or three O in a row, that player wins. If all nine squares are filled and neither player has three in a row, the game is a draw.


## Used technologies

Html, Css, javascript, Jquery

## How it works

When you press on a cell, javascript turns the ID of the cell into a row an a stroke which are saved into the array. Array is basically a matrix.
All calculation is based on matrix.

## Css
Crossing line appears on screen when there are 3 Id's  in row, stroke or diagonal line.


## Audio section

I used different _Audio() functions_ to use different sounds for wins, draw and restart button.
